        <h2>Preperation - Marination</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>
                This recipe needs half kg chicken (1.1 lbs.). Make few slits on all the chicken pieces and add to a large bowl. Then add
                <ul>
                    <li>3 tablespoons plain yogurt (Indian curd)</li>
                    <li>1 and 1/4 tablespoons ginger garlic paste</li>
                    <li>1/2 to 1 tablespoon garam masala (or biryani masala)</li>

                    <li>1/2 to 1 teaspoon red chili powder (reduce if you're white)</li>
                    <li>1 tablespoon of lemon juice (optional)</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Mix everything well and marinate the chicken. Cover and set this aside for 1 hour. You can also rest it overnight in the fridge.</li>
            <li>Meanwhile, add 2 cups of basmati rice to a large pot and rinse it at least three times. Drain and soak in fresh water for 30 mins. Drain to a colander after 30 mins. <em>Optional</em>-Soak a pinch of saffron strands in 2 tablespoons hot milk.</li>
        </ol>

        <h2>Cooking Chicken</h2>
        <ol start="4">
            <li>
                Heat ghee or oil in a heavy bottom pot or pressure cooker. Make sure you use a large on for this. Using whole spices is optional but recommended. Use whatever you have. I use
                <ul>
                    <li>1 bay leaf</li>
                    <li>4 green cardamoms</li>
                    <li>6 cloves</li>
                    <li>1 inch cinammon piece</li>
                    <li>1 star anise</li>
                    <li>3/4 teaspoon shahi jeera (caraway seeds)</li>
                    <li>1 strand mace</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Add thinly sliced onions. On a medium heat, fry them stirring often until uniformly light brown.</li>
            <li>Cook the onions until they reach a light brown color.</li>
            <li>Add marinated chicken & saute until it becomes pale for 5 minutes.</li>
            <li>Lower the flame completely. Cover and cook until the chicken is soft, tender, and completely cooked.</li>
            <li>Check if the chicken is cooked by pricking with a fork or knife. It has to be just cooked and not overdone. Evaporate any excess moisture left in the pot by cooking further without the lid.</li>
            <li>
                Taste test and add more salt if needed. Now add
                <ul>
                    <li>1/4 cup plain yogurt (Indian curd)</li>
                    <li>1 teaspoon garam masala (or biryani masala)</li>
                    <li>1/4 to 1/2 teaspoon red chili powder (optional)</li>
                    <li>1 slit green chili pepper (optional)</li>
                    <li>2 tablespoons chopped mint leaves (pudina)</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ol>

        <h2>Make chicken biryani</h2>
        <ol start="11">
            <li>Mix everything well. Spread it evenly in a single layer.</li>
            <li>Layer drained rice all over the chicken. To a seperate bowl, pour 3 cups water and 1/4 to 1/2 teaspoon salt. If cooking in a pot, start with 3 cups water at this stage.
                <br>
                Stir and taste the water. It must be slightly salty. Pour 2 cups of this across the sides of the cooker or pot. Pour the rest of the water over the rice gengtly.
            </li>
            <li>Level the rice gently on top. Add 2 tablespoons more mint leaves. Do not mix up everything, the taste of the biryani cooked in the shown method is good. Optionally, you can sprinkle 2 tablespoons fried onions & saffron soaked milk.</li>
            <li>Finally, cover the pot or cooker.
                <br>
                <strong>If cooking in a pot,</strong> cook on a medium heat until the rice is done completely. If the rice is undercooked, pour 1/4 to 1/2 cup boiling water at this stage. How much to add depends on the quality of basmati rice. Cook covered until the biryani is perfectly done, grainy, and fully cooked. Rest it covered for 15 mins.
                <br>
                <strong>If cooking in a cooker,</strong> cook for 1 whistle. Later, remove the cooker from the hot burner to stop cooking further.
            </li>
            <li>When the pressure releases naturally, open the lid. Gently fluff up with a fork.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>Voila! That's chicken biryani for ya.</p>
